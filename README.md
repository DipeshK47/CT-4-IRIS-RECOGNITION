# Iris Flower Classification Project

The Iris Flower Classification Project is a machine learning project focused on classifying iris flowers into their respective species using various classification algorithms. This repository contains the implementation of different machine learning models trained on the famous Iris dataset.

## Introduction

The Iris Flower Classification Project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to categorize iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The primary objective is to develop a model that accurately predicts the species of iris flowers using supervised learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, collected by Ronald Fisher in 1936. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with each sample characterized by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset includes three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, with 50 samples for each species.

## Models Implemented

Several machine learning models were implemented and evaluated for this project:

- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNN)
- Logistic Regression

The SVC model demonstrated the highest accuracy in classifying the iris flowers into their respective species.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- scikit-learn
